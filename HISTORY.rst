0.2.3 (2018-04-27)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Renamed tell_json to tell
- Fixed strict=False in json.loads to accept all bytes
- Fixed support for python2, specifically json.loads rejecting bytes


0.2.0 (2018-04-26)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Deprecated all "tell_*" methods of soctransmitter except tell_raw and tell_json
- Both tell_raw and tell_json take an optional tag (str) to indicate what kind of message is transmitted
- tell_json method automatically conserves the type of the value passed
- tell_json method takes an optional unpack (bool, default True) argument that allows to not automatically unpack the message upon reception


0.1.13 (2017-12-17)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Added tell_json and tell_json_ext which are able to pass any data structure, and keep the type information.
- tell_json is a convenience method that uses a pure-json implementation of the serializer, which means that python3 will not be able to serialize bytes.
- tell_json_ext is a custom serializer that is cross-consistent between python 2 and 3, and will deal properly with bytes as well as datetime objects.
- fix README


0.1.9 (2017-11-12)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added tell_list_type and tell_dict_type which keep the type of the data over transmission (works for int, float, bool, None, Byt, datetime.datetime, datetime.date, datetime.time, str, unicode (Pyt2), and bytes (Pyt3))
- Modified 'tell' methods to accept unicode characters. Python3 built-in 'str' and Pyhton2 built-in 'unicode' are encoded as "utf-8", Python2 built-in 'str' and Python2/3 'bytes' are encoded as "ascii" (i.e. "latin-1").


0.1.8 (2017-10-28)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added tell_list
- Fixed infinite connection looping when adding two socreceivers with same name


0.1.7 (2017-04-04)
++++++++++++++++++

- Implemented connect parameter in SocReceiver
- Fixed bug on key being compared to instance Byt
- Fixed bug with 'key' keyword in tell_key


0.1.4 (2017-04-03)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added hostname to SocReceiver
- Added tell_key method to SocTransmitter to send any key-type of dictionary


0.1.2 (2017-03-22)
++++++++++++++++++

- Made timeout parameter of acknowledgement of receipt accessible


0.1.1 (2017-03-09)
++++++++++++++++++

- Improved high-frequency management of communications
- Changed maximum communication frequency to 100 Hz; faster communications are merged


0.1.0 (2017-03-05)
++++++++++++++++++

- Initial release
